# Launch a static website on Amazon S3

Deploying your static website on Amazon S3 is a cost-effective solution that is often cheaper than a traditional hosting provider.

Here we will create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold a static website files and put Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve the website globally. Amazon Route 53 will manage your domain name(optional), and AWS Certificate Manager will provide a valid SSL/TLS certificate(optional).

### Services used
- Amazon S3
- CloudFront
- Route53
- AWS Certificate Manager

### Prerequistes
- AWS Account
- Static website made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc
